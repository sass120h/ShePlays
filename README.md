Sports Analytics has reached new levels and the data generated can now be utilized to create winning game strategies, this project is developed in the same arena. It involves creating a model that will predict the outcome of the NCAA Women’s Basketball tournament based on historical data. It takes support from various techniques of Machine learning, namely Supervised Learning, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Cross Validation, Regularization etc. to finally meet the goal of estimating the win, lose and draw probabilities of each matchup in the NCAA Women’s Basketball tournament.



DATA

The DataUsed folder contains the data files required for the project. All the raw CSV files that were obtained from the Kaggle data source are uploaded here. 


WORKSPACE STRUCTURE

data_1998_2017 -> Includes the two files containing the code for algorithms logistic_regression and random_forest for the historical data between the years 1998 to 2017

data_2010_2017 -> Includes the two files containing the code for algorithms logistic_regression and random_forest for the historical data between the years 2010 to 2017

data_2018 -> Includes the prediction for 2018 tournament using the best model


Before running the above Jupyter notebook  files, the required data files must uploaded in the Databricks "Data" folder under the dbfs folder.
